# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a recent graduate looking to break into data science, utilizing my background
 in both programming and statistics. Throughout my academic journey, I have not only learned 
 how to program in several languages, perform statistical techniques on datasets and create 
 visualizations, but also apply what I've learned to real-life scenarios. This has allowed 
 me to see the impact and importance of data analytics.'
